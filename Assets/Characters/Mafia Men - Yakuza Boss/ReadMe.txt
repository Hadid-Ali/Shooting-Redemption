Thank you for choosing this package !

(1) Two texture sets are included. 
"TEX PBR MetalRough" is designed to be used with the new built-in metal roughness shader called Autodesk Interactive
in Unity version 2018.3 (previous Standard Roughness).
"TEX Unity Metallic" is designed to be used with the defult Unity Standard shader.
We recommand Autodesk Interactive shader for better visual quality.

(2) Unity post processing stack (ver. above 2.0) and linear color space are required in order to achieve the same visual appearance shown in the 
promo video.
